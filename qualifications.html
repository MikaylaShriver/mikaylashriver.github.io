		<h1>The Technical Stuff</h1>

			<p>I graduated from a tiny athletics-minded high school (graduating class: 38) in 2011, although I was supposed to graduate in 2012. I was never a big fan of public school - I was weird, different, and lonely. I begged to homeschool or start in a private school where I could focus my interests better - but the money was never there. So at fourteen, I decided I’d graduate by sixteen. By seventeen, I started my first semester at Baylor University, uncertain of what I was going to do - and by winter 2012, I decided that changing majors so many times was too financially risky at a big private school. I graduated from McLennan Community College in 2014 with a general-focused Associate of Arts - after several breaks and many tears. I’m returning to Texas State Technical College’s Waco campus in the fall of 2016 to double-major in graphic design and photography - it’s only two more Associates’ degrees, but it’s a step in the right direction.</p>

			<p>My work experience is highly varied - I’ve primarily worked in preschool education, because it’s one of the rare jobs I qualify for in this tiny city. I’ve done retail, I’ve done call center, I’ve done preschool photography (yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like), and I’ve recently become a personal assistant to one of my favorite people - graphic artist Allison House. Under that guidance, I’m building all the skills necessary to jump into the design world and make a difference.</p>

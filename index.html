			<p>Enigma wrapped in chaos, bundled into a Texas woman with a wild spirit and fiery passion.</p> 

			<p>In short, I’m a bit of a burrito.</p>

			<p>All silliness aside, I’m a dreamer of impossible dreams. I’m inherently creative, and I come from a long line of hobby artists in varying mediums - clay, charcoal, pencil, paint, a guitar, the stage, the written word. As for me? I like to call myself a budding Jill-of-all-trades. Putting words on paper (or in a document) helps me to focus my attention. Playing piano lifts my spirit and inspires me. Painting brings out my messier but detail-oriented nature. Dancing expresses the deepest part of my soul in a way that words fail to successfully describe. Taking pictures with my DSLR and running them through Lightroom reminds me of the beauty of Creation, especially on the days when my soul is tired.</p>

			<p>I suppose that last medium - photography and editing - is part of why I’ve developed such an interest in design. My passions are so scattered that I’ve spent much of my young adulthood struggling to figure out where to focus, what career path to start trudging down. When I realized that I might just have what it took as an artist to make a difference, I decided that photography and graphic design would be my working mediums. I want my art to have significance. I want it to be poignant. I want it to stir the most powerful emotions in someone’s soul.</p>
